# Challenge

## Write a function `findMissedNumbers()` whose input is a list of length n, consisting of integers in the range from 1 to n.  
This function should return a list of all numbers that are not in the input list but are in the range from 1 to n.

An example of how this function works:

```python
findMissedNumbers([4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]) --> [5, 6]
findMissedNumbers([1, 1, 1]) --> [2, 3]
```
